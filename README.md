☁️this is who ur talking to.... if you even care...

☁️character is Souma Shiki (just like me fr) from Play it cool, Guys! / picg. PLEASE watch it, its such a nice casual watch w/ 10 minute episodes

☁️usually on ponytown while being afk/offtab, feel free to sit with me and my friends! we dont bite (ana does sometimes tho)

☁️most often in the enstars-genshin area, but if im not there im probably either in the library or in the twst/obey me area in the market

☁️i dont give out my socials! really sorry, u can friend me on roblox through my carrd tho LOL

☁️if my ponies were ever hypothetically used as inspo id twirl my hair and giggle and kick my feet and jump for joy. im totally fine w/ it

☁️no dni list but if you do something that makes me (or my friends) uncomfortable or morally doesnt sit right with me, i just wont interact, dont be a weirdo
