☁️PLEAAASEEE DROP MEDIA RECOMMENDATIONS!!! ill take everything you got bro. I like musicals, anime, movies, books, tv shows, cartoons, music projects, music in general, mobile games, video games in general, ANYTHING I CAN GET MY HANDS ON! I love to learn about new things! its part of the reason i play this game actually!!!

☁️feel free to ramble to me about things youre passionate about! strangers or friends welcome <3 promise im friendly and you really dont have to be shy :3

☁️usually on ponytown while being afk/offtab, feel free to sit with me and my friends! we dont bite (ana does sometimes tho /j)

☁️here for a good time AND a long one bro! im usually online most of the day and a bit throughout the night

☁️i dont give out my socials! really sorry, u can friend me on roblox through my carrd tho LOL

☁️if my ponies were ever hypothetically used as inspo id twirl my hair and giggle and kick my feet and jump for joy. im totally fine w/ it

☁️no dni list but if you do something that makes me (or my friends) uncomfortable or morally doesnt sit right with me, i just wont interact, dont be a weirdo
